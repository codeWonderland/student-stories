    <p class="ss-quote">“I did a kindergarten placement in Burlington, which has a large refugee population, and my class included students from Nepal, Afghanistan and Middle Eastern countries. I was so glad to have my Core classes to help me gain a global perspective, so I could better relate to students from all over the world.”</p>
