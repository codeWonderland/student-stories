    <p class="ss-quote">“I made great friends at Admitted Student Day that I still talk to everyday. At the event I was able to see the campus in not as much of a tour sense, but more just seeing the students talk to each other and spending time with people. It was really eye opening and it set in stone everything for me about Champlain.”</p>
