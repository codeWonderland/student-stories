    <p class="ss-quote">“Core provides such a unique approach to ‘general education’ because it’s hardly ‘general.’ My future employers probably won’t ask me to take a test or memorize things, but they probably will expect me to be contribute to meaningful discussions and to work well as part of a team. Those are skills that have thoroughly been developed in my Core classes.”</p>
