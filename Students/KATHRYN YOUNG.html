    <p class="ss-quote">“I wanted to go as far away as possible for college because I’m from Burlington, and I didn’t want to stay home. So, it was crazy that I found this little community at Champlain. My mother actually works here, and I grew up on this campus. I remember running through the Stiller School of Business hallway doing cartwheels when I was four years old. I gave Champlain a chance, and I realized this was a home for me.”</p>
