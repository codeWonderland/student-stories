    <p class="ss-quote">“As a commuter, I was really afraid that it was going to be very hard to fit in because everyone lives in the residence halls. But I’ve made hundreds of friends here, and it hasn’t really been a problem. There’s a commuter group, and they have a Facebook page. They do events pretty monthly. There’s a lot of good benefits, and Champlain treats commuter students well.”</p>
    <p class="ss-squote">“I think a strength of Champlain's professors is they really care. They go out of their way to help students.”</p>
