    <p class="ss-quote">“The Game Programming major at Champlain is very unique. We bridge divisions — we’re part of the Game Studio which is in CCM, but we’re programmers at the core and part of the ITS division. So, we do the general ITS courses that make us good programmers, but we also collaborate with the other game majors to make full-fledged games.”</p>
    <p class="ss-squote">“As game programmers we work with the game engines to make sure that the game designers have the tools they need to use to create fun and engaging games.”</p>
