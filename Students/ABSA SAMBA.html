    <p class="ss-quote">“When you first come here as an international student you participate in a week-long orientation where you get to know more about the school and go out and do things in Vermont and Burlington especially. You meet other international students and engage in activities during the semester that bring the international students together in a community on campus. I didn't know how it would feel to come here, but I love it.”</p>
