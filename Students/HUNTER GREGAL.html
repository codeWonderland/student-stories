    <p class="ss-quote">“The Cybersecurity program and my overall experience at Champlain has been nothing short of enlightening. Inside of the classroom, I’ve learned the tricks-of-the-trade and how to leverage the amazing power of computers and to globally network different layers of digital communication. Outside of the classroom, I’ve had the joy of meeting many other people who really share my passion. This has led to the exchange of great conversations, new information and the formation of some lifelong friends.”</p>
