    <p class="ss-quote">“The cool thing about the professors is that they know that we’re not going to be in school forever. They understand that our lives are not always just taking classes and doing homework; there is life outside of classes that is important as well. Professors understand that there needs to be a balance between school and outside school.”</p>
