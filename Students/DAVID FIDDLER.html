    <p class="ss-quote">“I did the Montreal Filmmaking Summer Program, which is really rigorous. They walk you through every part of how to make a film. We took writing classes, photography classes and producing classes. We walked through everything from writing a script to shooting footage. We had to shoot something new every single week. At the end of the semester, everyone had produced a film. We got to go to a theater and see our films….it was amazing to see my own work up on the screen.”</p>
